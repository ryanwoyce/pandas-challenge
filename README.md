Module 4 Challenge

This repository contains the code I used to complete the module 4 challenge as well as the resources that are refrenced in my script 

Inside the PyCitySchools folder you will find both the "Resources" folder which contains the csv files I refrenced, and the "Main_Script" file which contains my code and my Written Report. 

I ran into issues when I got to the "Scores by School Spending" section, but I filled out all the areas where code was required to the best of my ability.
