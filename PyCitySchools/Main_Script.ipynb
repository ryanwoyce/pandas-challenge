    "Analysis: \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this analysis is to gain a comprehensive understanding of how the school district can best allocate its budget. To accomplish this, I analyzed various aspects related to school performance and considered the current budget allocated to those schools.\n",
    "Initially, I conducted a comprehensive assessment of the entire district, focusing on crucial elements such as total student population, overall budget, and reading and math test scores.\n",
    "Next, I proceeded to analyze the same factors as before, but this time I examined them on a school-by-school basis. This approach provided me with valuable insights into the individual impact of each school on the overall district and enabled me to determine the specific budgetary needs of each school.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two Conclusions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Based on the information provided in the per_school_summary DataFrame, 8 out of 15 schools achieved an Overall Passing Rate greater than or equal to 70%. These schools received a budget allocation of $7,301,505, which accounted for 29.6% of the total budget. In contrast, the remaining 7 schools, with an overall Passing Rate lower than 70%, were allocated $17,347,923, representing 70.4% of the budget. This statistic underscores the fact that simply providing schools with more financial resources does not guarantee an improvement in the Overall Passing Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Additionally, referring to the per_school_summary, it is noteworthy that all 8 schools with a passing rate greater than 70% were classified as charter schools, whereas the 7 schools with an overall passing rate lower than 70% were categorized as district schools. While our analysis revealed that budget allocation does not necessarily correlate with academic success, this observation suggests that there may be certain factors contributing to academic achievement that are exclusive to charter schools, which are not explicitly outlined in the available DataFrame.\n",
